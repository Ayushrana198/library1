        <h2>Personally-Identifiable Information</h2>
        <p>The libraryâ€™s privacy policy prohibits the release of personal information about any user of library services, in person or online, including user activity (books checked out, fines, etc.), to other individuals or organizations, unless authorized by the user. Information is never revealed to any third party except by a warrant, court order, or subpoena authorized by national, state, or local law. All access to and use of personal information is restricted to library-related business.</p>

        <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
        <p>The library webpage and library catalog link to websites and services that are not controlled by the LMS Library. Where LMS have licenses with vendors for digital information resources, every attempt is made to include user information protection in the license agreement. When linked to another site, you are subject to the privacy policy of the new site. Please review the privacy statements and policies at these external sites.</p>

        <h2>Site Security</h2>
        <p>To guard against unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and promote the correct use of information, we have implemented physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.</p>
        <p>While we consider these measures reasonable, we can give no guarantee that they will always protect against invalid access or improper activity. For this reason, we avoid keeping information beyond the term of its primary use, and where possible we encrypt or delete data elements that might cause activities to be linked to individual users.</p>

        <h2>Cookies</h2>
        <p>A "cookie" is information stored on your workstation by a web server and used to customize your web service in some way. LMS Library webservers do not use cookie technology and do not place cookies on the workstations of our users. Some databases use temporary cookies; the LMS Library, however, does not retain these cookies.</p>
